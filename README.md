# Gallery of Generative Art

The primary motivation for this app is to act as a platform to make goofy programatic art.

While there is a gallery aspect to this app, we will keep that as simple as possible for the time being. Most of the initial development should evolve around what Iâ€™m calling `ArtKit`. A framework which should make it easier to bootstrap your project and get cool stuff on screen faster.
